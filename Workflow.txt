Step 1: Setting Up the Python Microservice with FastAPI
1.1 Install Python Dependencies
To begin, make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.

pip install fastapi uvicorn langchain openai google-api-python-client transformers

1.2 Create a Python File (app.py)
In your Python project folder, create a file named app.py to define your FastAPI service.

from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
from langchain.llms import HuggingFaceLLM
from langchain.tools import GoogleSearchAPIWrapper
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.agents import Tool, initialize_agent

# Initialize FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()

# Load Llama 3.3 70B model using HuggingFace (Ensure model is available or path is correct)
llama_model = HuggingFaceLLM(model_name="meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70b", device="cuda")  # Adjust if you're using a local model

# Initialize the Google Search tool
google_search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper()

# Define the tool
tools = [
    Tool(
        name="GoogleSearch",
        func=google_search.run,
        description="Search the web for relevant information"
    )
]

# Initialize LangChain agent for RAG
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llama_model, agent_type="zero-shot-react-description", verbose=True)

# Request body model
class QueryRequest(BaseModel):
    query: str

# Endpoint to handle user queries
@app.post("/ask")
async def ask_question(request: QueryRequest):
    user_query = request.query
    result = agent.run(user_query)  # Use LangChain's agent for RAG processing
    return {"response": result}

Llama 3.3 70B Model: This code loads the model via HuggingFace (meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70b). If the model is hosted locally, you’ll need to specify its path.
Google Search API: We use LangChain's GoogleSearchAPIWrapper to fetch relevant documents based on the user’s query.
Agent Initialization: The agent combines the search and Llama model to process the queries and return a response.

1.3 Run the FastAPI Server
To run your FastAPI app, use Uvicorn:

uvicorn app:app --reload

This will start your FastAPI service at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Step 2: Connect Python API to TypeScript Project
Now, we’ll make your TypeScript application communicate with the FastAPI service we’ve just created.

2.1 Install Axios for HTTP Requests
If you don’t have Axios installed, run:

npm install axios

This will allow you to send HTTP requests from your TypeScript app to the FastAPI backend.

2.2 Create TypeScript Function to Call the Python API
In your TypeScript project, create a file where you’ll handle user queries (e.g., chatbot.ts).

import axios from 'axios';

// Function to send a query to the Python API and get a response
async function askPythonBot(query: string): Promise<string> {
    try {
        const response = await axios.post('http://127.0.0.1:8000/ask', {
            query: query,
        });

        // Return the response from the Python model
        return response.data.response;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error calling Python API:', error);
        return 'Sorry, I couldn’t get an answer at the moment.';
    }
}

// Example usage in the chatbot flow
async function handleUserQuery(userQuery: string) {
    const botResponse = await askPythonBot(userQuery);
    console.log('Bot Response:', botResponse);
}

// Simulate a query from a user
handleUserQuery('What are the latest advancements in AI?');

askPythonBot: Sends a POST request with the user’s query to the FastAPI service at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ask. It receives the processed response from the Python service and returns it to the user.
handleUserQuery: This simulates handling a query in your chatbot. The response is logged or displayed in your UI, depending on your implementation.

2.3 Integrate with TypeScript Chatbot Flow
If you already have a chatbot framework (e.g., using Express.js), integrate the askPythonBot function into the route handling.

import express from 'express';
import axios from 'axios';

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/chat', async (req, res) => {
    const userQuery = req.body.query;
    const botResponse = await askPythonBot(userQuery);  // Send query to Python API
    res.json({ response: botResponse });  // Return bot's response to the client
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});

Step 3: Connecting File Paths and Configurations
Model Path (Llama 3.3 70B):

If you’re hosting Llama 3.3 70B locally, provide the file path for the model in the model_name parameter in the HuggingFaceLLM setup in your Python FastAPI service.
Example for local models:

llama_model = HuggingFaceLLM(model_name="/path/to/your/llama-3.3-70b", device="cuda")

(DO NOT GET OVERWHELMED YOU WONT REQUIRE THIS MOST PROB IF YOU SUCCESSFULLY GET THE MODEL ON HUGGINGFACE)

Google Search API Key:

If you’re using Google Search API, ensure you have the API key configured properly. For GoogleSearchAPIWrapper, the API key and credentials must be set up.

Example for configuring the search API in Python:

from googleapiclient.discovery import build
# Initialize Google Custom Search API with the API key
api_key = "YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY"
cx = "YOUR_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID"
google_search = build("customsearch", "v1", developerKey=api_key)

||>> 1. Running the Python FastAPI Service on localhost
After setting up the FastAPI service, you can run it directly on your local machine without Docker.

Steps:
Ensure FastAPI and Uvicorn are installed: If you haven’t already installed FastAPI and Uvicorn, do so by running:

pip install fastapi uvicorn

Run the FastAPI Service: Navigate to the directory where your app.py (Python service) is located and run it using Uvicorn:

uvicorn app:app --reload

This will start the server at http://127.0.0.1:8000 by default. The FastAPI service will now be running locally.

2. Running the TypeScript Application on localhost
Ensure your TypeScript dependencies are installed (like Axios if needed):

npm install axios express

Start your TypeScript server (or directly run your chatbot code): Assuming you are using Node.js (with Express.js or another framework), run the application with:

npm run start

This will start the TypeScript server (e.g., at http://localhost:3000).

3. Communication Between the Two Services
For communication between the TypeScript and Python services on localhost:

Python FastAPI Service is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
TypeScript Service (Express) will run on a different port, e.g., http://localhost:3000/.
When the user interacts with your TypeScript-based chatbot, it will call the Python API to get the response. Here’s how that communication works:

The TypeScript server will send an HTTP POST request to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ask with the user's query.
The FastAPI service will process the query using the Llama 3.3 70B model and return the response.
The TypeScript server receives the response and sends it back to the user.

4. Ensure Both Services Are Running
For everything to work properly:

FastAPI Service must be running on port 8000 (or whichever port you've chosen in the uvicorn command).
TypeScript App (Express or other framework) must be running on its designated port, such as port 3000.
If either service is down or not running on the expected port, the communication between them will fail.

5. Testing the Local Setup
Start the FastAPI Python service first (uvicorn app:app --reload).
Then, start the TypeScript server.
Test by sending a query from your TypeScript app and check the response.

Just make sure that:

The Python FastAPI server is running and accessible on http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

The TypeScript application is running and making requests to the correct URL (http://127.0.0.1:8000/ask).

Everything will work seamlessly as long as the services are properly connected.
